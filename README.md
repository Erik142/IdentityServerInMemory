# IdentityServerInMemory

This is a sample project implementing an identity server with OpenID Connect using IdentityServer4 in .NET 6.0. The goal of this sample project is to create a proof of concept for how to implement multi-tenancy authentication in IdentityServer using separate HTTP REST-API:s for each individual tenant, where each tenant have their own set of users. This is in no way, shape or form ready for production use. It is simply a project made for educational use, nothing more, nothing less.
